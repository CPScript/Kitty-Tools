## Network

There are some error codes you might get in return when attempting to use the answer hack. Here are a few of those listed to go ahead and help before you make an issue!

* **HTTP Error : 403 - Forbidden** ~ The quiz you are attempting to acces using the quiz ID is most likely private. Try again and see if you get the same responce.
* **HTTP Error :400 - Bad Request** ~ You will see this when you type the quiz ID incorrectly. Try re-typing it.
* **HTTP Error :404 - Not found** ~ The quiz you are attempting to get answer from does not exist.
  
## Bot

There are some isses with the current bot implementation.

* **NPM: Not found** ~ You will need to install NPM properly. This project will automate the full process.

* **The bot only supports 4 answer quizes.** It wont be able to do TOF, polls, typing questions, etc. ~ Im working on makiing a new bot that will support more quiz formats. the current bot was not made by me but edited.
